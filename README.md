A simpler footstep solution that should work with Unreal version 226b or below, or 436 (Unreal Tournament). Does not require 227 or 469.

If used as-is, it requires ProofOfConceptGame to be set as the gametype. I recommend not using it as-is and instead including the code in your own mods and adjusting it to work with your mod's custom gametype and playerpawn instead.
